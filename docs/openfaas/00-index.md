At the end of this guide you will be running OpenFaaS with the following characteristics:

* secure OpenFaaS ingress with Letâ€™s Encrypt TLS and authentication
* encrypted communication between OpenFaaS core services and functions with Istio mutual TLS
* isolated functions with Istio Mixer rules
* Jaeger tracing and Prometheus monitoring for function calls
* canary deployments for OpenFaaS functions
